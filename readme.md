## Description

This plugin produces a report of which short links get clicked the most. It is inspired by the [popular clicks](https://github.com/miconda/yourls/tree/master/plugins/popular-clicks) plugin (and others) but modified to suit how I want to see the data displayed.

The plugin which inspired this works in periods of days to the second from when you load the page, however you can't see what happened yesterday (*e.g.* midnight to midnight), only the preceeding 24 hour period.  This plugin solves that problem.


## Installation

1. In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `best-links`.
2. Drop these files in that directory.
3. Go to the Plugins administration page (*eg* `http://sho.rt/admin/plugins.php`) and activate the plugin.
4. Have fun!
